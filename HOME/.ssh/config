# Allow the private key to be selected automatically: IdentityFile ~/.ssh/%l_%r@%h_id_rsa
# SSH will replace %l with the local machine name,

# To connect from localhost called foo to bar as user, I run, `ssh bar`, 
# And ssh would automatically use: `~/.ssh/foo_user@bar_id_rsa`
# This will allow home directories to be shared over NFS (different key per machine!) 
# Or automatically identify which machine the key was meant to be on.
