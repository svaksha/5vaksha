# YAKSHA

__My personal automation daimons :: use at your own risk!__

The term __YAKSHA__, is used to refer to ["fairies", "demons" and "spirits"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaksha) in Sanskrit. This repo is my personal automation daimon for cross-platform __*nix__ dev installation, updates, backups, bash scripts, dockerfiles, playbooks, dotfiles and configuration files. 

I turned towards automation in my quest for a standard development environment across multiple machines. Manual customization was time-consuming and error-prone, not to mention, a big time-sink that resulted in discrepancies with machines that worked differently, programs ran differently, broke unexpectedly or worse, dependency-hell. 

I used shell scripts to manage the `apt-get` install process for many years but these old bash scripts are being (slowly) retired. ATM, I am in the process of porting to use `ansible`, an agentless distro-agnostic tool to manage my dev environments. You can find this repo on [galaxy-ansible](https://galaxy.ansible.com/svaksha) too.

PS: The old shell/ bash scripts work, but are unsupported & unmaintained.

# INSTALL

Installation processes have constantly evolved over the years, so there may be some legacy code that needs pruning or still needs to be ported to ansible. Hence, the constant [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) sandbox status may break your machine. 

Currently, the repository structure is:

* __/roles__: Splitting ansible playbooks for different tasks requires a [roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) directory.

## Basic Installation Process

1. At the outset, your Ubuntu machine should have _Ansible and Git_ intalled.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ansible git
```

You can also use `pip` to install ansible but I prefer the `apt-get` package. Note that if you have a standalone machine this step is a manual process, else automated for the network installation.

2. Now clone [this repo][https://github.com/svaksha/yaksha/]. For SSH, use the URL `git@github.com:svaksha/yaksha.git` via the clone command:

```
git clone ssh://github.com/svaksha/yaksha.git
```

Alternatively, Github offers HTTPS (replace the ssh with https in the above command) as transfer protocols or the repo can be downloaded as a [zip-file][https://github.com/svaksha/yaksha/archive/master.zip] (latest 'master' branch). 

3. Then, to run all the ansible playbooks sequentially, 'cd' into the directory and run the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ cd yaksha

$ ansible-playbook -b -K yaksha.yml
```

The above runs all the playbooks listed in the yaksha.yml` file. But, if you want to individually run specific playbooks, e.g. install only Ubuntu package-deps via apt-get, then run the ansible playbooks inside the /ubuntu folder, viz. 


```
ansible-playbook -b -K ubuntu/ansible-ubuntu.yaml
```
